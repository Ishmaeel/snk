&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things about which we were queried most frequently has been the meaning of &quot;Sterile Noiz Klan&quot;.
To be honest, our name does not convey really deep meanings. In fact, the story is relatively simple: You see, we are walking down 
the street, trying to come up with a name for our band. Ozan insists that the name must include the word &quot;klan&quot; and also 
it should be reasonably long. Since Ozan is the BIG man in the band, no one argues otherwise :-) So, we say, what about the rest?
At that time, one of our favorite songs is &quot;Sterile Prophet&quot; by Godflesh. Let's throw in a &quot;sterile&quot; too, then.
What do we have? Sterile Klan. Nah, we say, there's something missing (and Ozan says, it's still SHORT!). Again, at that time,
Burak was roaming with the nickname &quot;NOIZ&quot; within IRC channels. So be it, we say, it's &quot;Sterile Noiz Klan&quot;!
And that's all there is to it, really.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that you know how the band was named, you just may wonder how it was formed. Fortunately, forming of the band
was not another silly game. All of the current members of the band have previous experiences in several scenes. Ozan and Taner have
played in an electro-industrial band, &quot;NaivePoppers&quot;. Then, there was &quot;Autumn&quot;, a doom/death band that featured
Ozan, Taner and Burak. Later, Burak and Murat were in a hardcore-punk band, &quot;DogFight&quot;.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, Ozan, Burak, Murat and Hakan decided to go industrial and formed SNK. At first, the band was purely
amateur, much like the previous ones. However, Hammer Müzik listened to the band, and came up with a contract. In 1998, SNK
started the recording of the first album, &quot;FIX&quot; in Forte Studio, Ýstanbul.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the band is at work on new material for a new album. It is anticipated that the recording of the second 
album will begin somewhen in the summer of the year 2001. Here's the latest line-up:<br><br>
