<a name="1"><B>PALE</B></a><br>
<br>
Everytime I look I see a deadpan in mirror<br>
Fear stuck in my head words lodged in my throat<br>
Investing illusions as I'm transfixed with terror<br>
I embrace all hope as if they are mine<br>
<br>
I'm pale<br>
<br>
Burying the past imprisoning memories<br>
All of my friends turned their backs on me<br>
And my love too there's no more deceiving<br>
I run away to a place no one knows<br>
<br>
Still so lonely you still remember all<br>
I'm logic inside you so I can't help no more<br>
<br>
These are the dark pages that I want to forget<br>
But they are so deep and fresh<br>
Now I'm buried within as you wish<br>
<br>
I'm pale<br>
<br>
Have no mercy for the past<br>
Have no mercy for memories<br>
Have no mercy for myself<br>
<br>
<a name="2"><b>PULSE</b></a><br>
<br>
I'm stuck in the middle of wrongs<br>
Can't stop if you don't use force<br>
Silently comes to your neck<br>
<br>
My friends have never come back<br>
I still hope to search myself<br>
Like no one dared<br>
<br>
And I fear only losing my sign<br>
Which is a pain under my skin<br>
Couldn't know when I did<br>
<br>
My thoughts are against the feelings<br>
Fears are against the thoughts<br>
We all are to the flames<br>
<br>
Today I'm really fading<br>
Heaven it's far away from me<br>
Never it isn't as it seems like<br>
Always shapes are misleading<br>
<br>
I'm exhausted<br>
<br>
<a name="3"><b>ANYBODY REALIZE ?</b></a><br>
<br>
When you see someone suffering turn your face<br>
To another place it is easier than understanding<br>
Nervous breakdown is everything my mind is<br>
Full of questions all all of them are without<br>
Answers I can't stand<br>
No more I'll descend<br>
This is our deadline<br>
Won't you feel the same ?<br>
I am deep in thought<br>
What is right or wrong ?<br>
Now minds are sterilized<br>
Anybody realize ?<br>
<br>
Voices in my head riding me over the edge<br>
<br>
When you fall down<br>
Maybe you can see<br>
It is also late<br>
Only will be mistake<br>
<br>
Everyday of sickness<br>
Just an empty flow<br>
All of these for what<br>
Anybody realize ?<br>
<br>
<a name="6"><b>CROWD</b></a><br>
<br>
All the crowd<br>
Just a life for what ?<br>
All the crowd<br>
Whenever I will trust ?<br>
All the ways<br>
Every side is blocked<br>
All the sins<br>
At the end of ways<br>
<br>
No one to hear no one to see no one to be on your side<br>
<br>
Without belief and without confidence<br>
Only violence inside your head<br>
Behind your shapes behind your eyes<br>
Senseless murders and selfless minds<br>
<br>
I'm here to find<br>
What I've lost right<br>
Here I search mine<br>
Once shone now gone<br>
<br>
I can't see your innocence<br>
I can't see I can't breathe<br>
I can't even believe it myself<br>
<br>
<a name="8"><b>SHINE</b></a><br>
<br>
Colors fade and lonely nights await<br>
Winter depression calls from the deep<br>
<br>
A distant horizon pale blue lights<br>
So I'll walk through the nights<br>
<br>
I just want winter sun<br>
winter sun always shine<br>
<br>
<a name="9"><b>LOST</b></a><br>
<br>
What we have lost is never to be found<br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
